I am an undergraduate student at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications][1], currently involved in my Graduation project focusing on "The Design and Implementation of a Stock Investment Assistant System Based on Transformer" technology. I'm also interested in computer vision, and have already done several interesting small projects with [ultralytics/yolov8][2] such as combining OCR with images to determine whether the label numbers are in the right order.
